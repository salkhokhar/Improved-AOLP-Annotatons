# Improved-AOLP-Annotatons
A better annotation of license plate localization and recognition of AOLP dataset.


The original annotations have parts of plates cropped out and there are even a couple of cases where the annotations doesn't even contain the license plate. It can have adverse effect on your model. Also, the recognition files only contain the characters and not their actual location. So, I have hand labelled all the images and the aanotations are in yolo format..
